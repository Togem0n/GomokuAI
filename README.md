# GomokuAI
Simple Gomoku AI using Alpha-Beta DFS(finished) and Alpha Zero(to be worked out)

# Alpha-Beta DFS(finished)
Based on Alpha-Beta DFS and Simple Features
Only about 500 lines in Python and GUI in PyGame
As a beginner of Python, I have tried my best to keep good coding style though it's not elegant at all ):
It has kind of low efficiency but simple implementation
